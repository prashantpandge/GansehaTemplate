				   <h2> Welcome...</h2>
				   <p>Ganesh Chaturthi (ISO: Gaṇeśa Chaturthī), also known as Vinayaka Chaturti (Vināyaka Chaturthī), 
				   is a Hindu festival celebrating the arrival of Ganesh to earth from Kailash Parvat with his mother 
				   Goddess Parvati/Gauri. The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesh clay idols privately 
				   in homes and publicly by Shri Bal Gangadhar Tilak popularly known as Lokmanya Tilak in Pune in the year 1893 
				   on elaborate pandals (temporary stages). Observations include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts such as, 
				   prayers and vrata (fasting). Offerings and prasāda from the daily prayers, that are distributed from the pandal to the 
				   community, include sweets such as modaka as it is believed to be a favourite of Lord Ganesh. The festival ends on the tenth 
				   day after start, when the idol is carried in a public procession with music and group chanting, then immersed in a nearby body of water
				   such as a river or sea. In Mumbai alone, around 150,000 statues are immersed annually. Thereafter the clay idol dissolves and 
				   Ganesh is believed to return to Mount Kailash to Parvati and Shiva.The festival celebrates Lord Ganesh as the God of New 
				   Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles as well as the god of wisdom and intelligence and is observed throughout India, 
				   especially in the states such as Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, West
				   Bengal, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu. Ganesh Chaturthi is also observed in Nepal and by the Hindu diaspora elsewhere such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, other parts of the Caribbean, 
				   
				   
				   Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa United States, and Europe.
